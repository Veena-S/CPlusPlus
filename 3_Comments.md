## Comments

Comments serve as a sort of in-code documentation. When inserted into a program, they are effectively ignored by the compiler;
they are solely intended to be used as notes by the humans that read source code. 
Although specific documentation is not part of the C++ standard, several utilities exist that parse comments with different documentation formats.

## Syntax

/* comment */	(1)	
// comment\n	(2)	

1) Often known as "C-style" or "multi-line" comments.
